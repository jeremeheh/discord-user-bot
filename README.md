# Discord User as Bot WORKS 2020!

If your looking to make you account a discord bot without the bot tag this repo will help you!


# How does it work

Same as creating a discord bot but you're using your **discord account** instead!

## What you'll need

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - For installing the required modules
- [Create a bot in discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) - You'll need a token for this.

## How to get your token on discord and make the bot

This is the most important step!
- Go to this [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in using your discord account.
- Click **New Application** at the top right of the screen and name the bot anything you want (it doesn't matter).

- Once your logged in press **F12** on your keyboard. Go to Application and click local storage a drop down should appear and click discord.com. Search for **TOKEN** and copy it's value!![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/7zPw2WT.png)
